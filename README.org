#+TITLE: emacs-hackles

This is just a lightly tweaked version of [[https://github.com/vibhavp/emacs-xkcd][emacs-xkcd]]
to read another comic.
I did very little work here, but learned a ton and now I can read a splendid old web comic.

Implementation of a [[https://hackles.org][hackles]] reader for GNU Emacs.

* Viewing comics:
  + ~hackles-get~ loads a user-specific xkcd.
  Files are cached (for later offline viewing) by default to =~/.emacs.d/hackles/=.
  This can be changed by changing ~hackles-cache-dir~ in emacs-hackles's customize menu.
  (~customize-group hackles~)

* Customization

  emacs-hackles can be customized with ~M-x customize-group hackles~.
  | Option                 | Use                                                     | Default value               |

  | ~hackles-cache-latest~ | File where the latest cached hackles's number is stored | =~/.emacs.d/hackles/latest= |
